These icons are customizable by installing a package that provides an `atom.file-icons` service.\n\nThe `atom.file-icons` service must provide the following methods:\n\n* `iconClassForPath(path)` - Returns a CSS class name to add to the file view\n* `onWillDeactivate` - An event that lets the tree view return to its default icon strategy\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/tree-view/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom/tree-view#readme","_id":"tree-view@0.198.0","_shasum":"6f54c3306a5dc1b27d4708c765d2514bf0ea12c8","_resolved":"file:../../../../d-11617-26278-qxzqv7/package.tgz","_from":"../../../../d-11617-26278-qxzqv7/package.tgz"}
